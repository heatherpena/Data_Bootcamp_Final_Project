# Data_Bootcamp_Final_Project


This project was completed by Heather Canul Pena in partial fulfilment of ECON-UB.0232, Data Bootcamp, Fall 2018. I certify that the NYU Stern Honor Code applies to this project. In particular, I have:


Clearly acknowledged the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as our own. The incorporation of the work of others–including but not limited to their ideas, data, creative expression, and direct quotations (which should be designated with quotation marks), or para- phrasing thereof– has been fully and appropriately referenced using notations both in the text and the bibliography.


And I understand that:

Submitting the same or substantially similar work in multiple courses, either in the same semester or in a different semester, without the express approval of all instructors is strictly forbidden.
I acknowledge that a failure to abide by NYU Stern Honor Code will result in a failing grade for the project and course.


Project Description
We are exploring the key components of a Best Picture and how they compare to the average movie. The overall analysis will be concluded with a hypothetical film that makes use of the results of our report as a viable candidate for Best Picture Winner. This report is conducted using two data sets: one containing every movie released within a specified range, while the other containing the metrics of all Best Picture Oscar Winners within those years. We will be analyzing these films through the use of the following original variables: name, budget, company, country, director, genre, gross, rating, released, runtime, score, star, votes, writer, nominations, metacritic, and year.
